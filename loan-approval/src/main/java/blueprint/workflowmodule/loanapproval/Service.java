/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #loanApprovalClosed} is the interesting one. It is business code like every other
 * method here - it closes the case - and nothing in it says that a BPMS end event is what
 * triggered it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the method the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow has to run in a transaction. It is deliberately absent from the
 * methods a task handler calls, and from the one the end notification calls: VanillaBP
 * already runs both in a transaction it owns.
