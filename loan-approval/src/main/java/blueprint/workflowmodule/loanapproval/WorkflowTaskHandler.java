/**
 * What the process tells the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * The end notification belongs here for the same reason the tasks do: it is the BPMS
 * calling in. {@code @WorkflowEnded} marks the method, VanillaBP loads the aggregate,
 * calls it and saves the aggregate - the same contract a {@code @WorkflowTask} method has.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>The notification is at-least-once</strong>, so what the method does has to
 * survive arriving twice. Writing a closing time and a status does; sending a letter would
 * not, and belongs in front of the end event as a task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code @Transactional} here, and adding one would be a mistake. VanillaBP
 * loads the aggregate, runs the method and saves the aggregate in one transaction it owns,
 * and it commits that transaction for a {@code TaskException} on purpose. A transaction
 * declared by the application would roll back instead and throw away what the handler
 * wrote for the process to react to.
 * </p>
