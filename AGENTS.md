# bpmn-workflow-ended

Tells the application that a workflow ended, whichever end event it reached, without a
service task in front of every one of them. A delta on top of `module-single`.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

| `closedAt`, `closedBy`, `closedAtEndEvent`       | what the end notification writes onto the aggregate                        |

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical in every
blueprint - copy them unchanged.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Decide what the application needs at the end. **Work** belongs into a task in front of the
   end event, where the model shows it. **The fact that the case is closed** belongs into a
   `@WorkflowEnded` method.
2. Add ONE method annotated with `@WorkflowEnded` to the class already annotated with
   `@WorkflowService`. It may take the workflow aggregate, a `WorkflowEnd`, or both in either
   order.
3. Write the outcome onto the workflow aggregate. That is what makes "closed" a fact of the
   business case rather than something to ask a BPMS about later.
4. **Make it survive arriving twice.** The notification is at-least-once, so setting a
   timestamp and a status is fine and sending anything is not.
5. Do NOT let a business decision depend on `endEventId()` or on the difference between
   `COMPLETED` and `TERMINATED`. Camunda 7 names the end event, Camunda 8 does not; a
   cancelled workflow is reported by some BPMS and by others not at all. Record what arrives,
   decide on the aggregate.
6. Do not model a task in front of an end event just to be told about the end. That is the
   pattern this blueprint replaces, and it has to be repeated for every end event added
   later.
7. Extend `LoanApprovalIT` with a test for an end which has NOTHING in front of it. A test
   whose branch ends with a task cannot tell whether the notification arrived or the task
   wrote it.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address` configured; do not report a
failure of that profile as a defect of the generated code before having checked it.

`LoanApprovalIT` proves the aspect and has to pass: both ends report, and the branch without a
task in front of its end event reports as well. Do not assert `endEventId` unless the BPMS in
use documents that it reports one - on Camunda 8 it is `null`, which is the SPI's documented
answer of an engine which cannot tell.

Do not report success without having run this.
